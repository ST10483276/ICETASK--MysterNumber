## Mystery Number game
The GuessingGame is a simple and interactive mobile application built through Visual Studio code via the virtual machine. The objective of this game is for the player to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The application provides feedback on each guess entered. Navigating the user until they find a correct number.

1. Random number generator: a random number between 1 and 100 is generated, which the player must guess when they start the game
2. User input: The player can enter their number in the input field. The app authorises the input to ensure the correct number was entered.
3. Feedback: after submission of the guessed number, the app provides instant feedback with the following
- If the guess is correct, a congratulations message is displayed.
- If the guess is high, the app tells the user the guess is too high.
- If the guess is low, the app tells the user the guess is too low.
4. Clear function: The user can clear their current guess and reset the game, which will generate a new random number to guess.
5. Exit option: The app includes an “Exit” button allowing the user to quit the application.

## My experience  during the building process
With my experience on the Integrated Curriculum Engagement task 2, I encountered some errors when running and checking my code, I felt frustrated when my application kept giving me errors and during my checking of my spelling, I noticed I missed the export function in the code which is vital for the application to run. 

Another experience I encountered was pushing via GitHub through the terminal. I was confused when the terminal and CMD said “remote origin already exists.” Meaning there was already a configured remote Origin for the repository. Eventually I did remove the origin with the command “git remote remove origin”, added a new origin and then pushed normally through the terminal and my app pushed correctly.
